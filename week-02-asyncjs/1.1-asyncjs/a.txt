1. Call Stack
The call stack is a data structure that keeps track of the function calls in your program. It operates in a "Last In, First Out" (LIFO) manner, meaning the last function that was called is the first one to be executed and removed from the stack. When a function is called, it gets pushed onto the call stack. When the function completes, it's popped off the stack.
2. Web APIs
Web APIs are provided by the browser (or the Node.js runtime) and allow you to perform tasks that are outside the scope of the JavaScript language itself, such as making network requests, setting timers, or handling DOM events.
3. Callback Queue 
The callback queue is a list of tasks (callbacks) that are waiting to be executed once the call stack is empty. These tasks are added to the queue by Web APIs after they have completed their operation.
4. Event loop
The event loop constantly checks if the call stack is empty. If it is, and there are callbacks in the callback queue, it will push the first callback from the queue onto the call stack for execution.
